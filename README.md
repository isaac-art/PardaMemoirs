# PardaMemoirs

These are the memoirs of my great-grandfather Dan Casey, written in 1931.

He talks about his experience growing up in London in the late 1800s, joining the 5th Dragoons and going to war.


I am using pytesseract to pull out the text from each scanned page, then 'cat them together in bash. 

TODO:
- [ ] grammer and spelling check (for the parts tesseract got wrong) 
- [ ] copy the formatting, underlines/bold/etc
- [ ] layout for printing 6x9"
