July, 1985

Dear Terry,

This is a copy of Parda. Casey‘s Book. There are ten copies; will you

please circulate it amongst your family. It has been typed by my
daughter-in-law Elizabeth, just as Parda wrote it, completely unabridged.

Perhaps members of your family were unaware of the existence of this
book. I apologise, but I have been very covetous of it for a few

reasons -

Parda brought it to Napping and gave it to my mother Kate for safe keeping
not long before his death in 1958, the photo was taken about the same time
by Vincent. It was written in a ledger and Vincent bound it beautifully.

My mother in turn gave it to me just before her death in 1968. I also
feel very attached to it because he started to write it just before I

was born. when he was to become a grandfather for the first time.

Parda was very conscious that this book should be preserved. because
there were others, at least one was loaned out and never returned to

him. It would be marvellous if this story could be continued and finished
with the help of the other books.

Parda to me was an ideal grandfather, one who imparted his knowledge and
experience of the world without dictating to his grandchildren. I'm sure
he implanted in me my sense of a real belonging to London, and I think

Vincent will tell you the same. 011 many occasions we accompanied him on

his travels, he really opened our eyes to the world.

Whilst we were evacuated to Hayfield in Sussex, Gran and Pards came for a
little break from the bombing in London. He collected us from school

at the Old Palace on his first day with us and said he recognised the Nuns'
Habit. He told my teacher, Mother Mary Winifred, the story of his sister
Katie. and said he thought she was attending a convent nearby when she was
killed.

‘
Mother Mary Winifred enquired at a neighbouring Convent, probably in Frant,
of some older Nuns. One said she recalled the event and she arranged for

him to visit the Convent.
