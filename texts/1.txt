MEMOIRS - July 27th, 1931

 

In writing this - I do so for my own amusement and not in any spirit of
vanity that I could accomplish such a task as the writing of anything that
could be called a "Book", or anything that would reach to what is called
"Book Form". I admit and I am proud of the fact that for years I have been
an omnivorous reader of books. And in my opinion The Master of all the
Authors I have ever read is The Immortal Charles Dickens. I have read his
works over and over again and each time I have discovered some fresh trait

or character which I have previously missed;

The question I am asking myself now is - What is required to write "Memoirs" ?

First of all â€” Ability. Secondly - Inspiration.
Thirdly - Sticking all the time to facts.
I maintain that with these qualifications any individual can write Memoirs.

And under the date I am writing it is the prevailing fashion. Statesmen

are writing. Generals are writing. German Officers are writing. As a
matter of fact to pick up the evening papers is to find that some sensational
book or the other has been published, and generally at a price of 12/6d or
some such prohibitive price that would prevent a working man if he so desired
from obtaining the same. And yet there are many thousands of working men
and women whose memoirs would be far more interesting to read and more

especially if they spoke and confessed to the Truth.

I have been told and I must confess I believe there are different degrees of
Truth. It would never do they say to tell the Truth. So they concoct a blend
of half lies and half truth and call it the Truth for the sake of Society.

And all join in - in this great game of Belief. Royalty - Statesmen -

Bishops and Priests - and Parents.
