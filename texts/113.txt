Such was a soldier‘s Christmas

In this little story I have just told
A Lion in the trenches

At home - 3 Lamb in the Fold.

Yet such are our British Soldiers
The men who with rifles and guns
Are British — True British

Well — We know - Boys

Who will beat the Kaiser and Huns.

Our rations used to be brought from Rail-head by motor lorries

and there arrived a consignment of new clothes and boots fram England,

a complete outfit for each man. So the Sargeant Major conceived a worthy
scheme that each man should have a hdt bath. He got a wash tub and by
frequent pails of hot water so many men were able to bath each night in
turns. As they came from the bath a Corporal took their names. It was

a long process. We were all anxious to cleanse ourselves. And as much

as we disliked the Sergeant Majcr and feared him, everyone admitted he

done his Best to make us clean. We had not had a bath since we left England.
All of us were lousy and very miserable. I thought it delicious to have

a clean shirt on once more. And it was the first time I had seen this
Sergeant Major smile, for he supervised the bathing. We now did some
mounted drills in preparation for the inspection by the King.

One morning early in November we formed up on the Meteron Road. There

had been a heavy fall of snow and the wind was very piercing. We sat there
on our horses waiting for the King to come along and it was a long wait.
Presently en our left I heard some cheering and then we got the command
"5th Dragoon Guards - Shun — Carry Swords“. I saw General Allenby our
Divisional General who commanded the 1st Cavalry Division talking to a very
short old gentleman in Field Marshal's uniform, it was the King of England.
His nose was red with the cold and he looked anything but happy. Behind him
was a. youthful figure in Khaki with a walking stick almost as big as himself.
