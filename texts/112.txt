—112—

And then this former sentry
With paper and pencil of lead
Sat down to write to his "Loved ones“

and these were the words he said.

Dear Wife and Children in England

I have not much news to tell

But the news that I know that will please you best
Is that I am fit and well.

Today has been rather "quiet"
For our dinner we had bully and bread
Some of our chaps are wounded

And young ”Jinky" Jones is dead.

We have not had many presents

But one that we accepted with glee

It came with the Best of wishes

From Her Royal Highness The Princess Mary.

There was a Pipe, Cigarettes and Tobacco
In a box designed so clear

And photos of their Majesties

Which I shall keep as a souvenir.

I hope m1; Christmas is happy Dear
For mine has been rather "bright"
Although I am out here doing my Duty
As a Defender of the Right.

In conclusion - Good—Bye

God Bless you Dear

Until we meet again

When the bells ring out their message
Peace on Earth - Goodwill to all Men.
