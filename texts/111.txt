Then there was Scarborough, Whitby,
Hartlepool. Zeppelin raids as well
So these our British Soldiers

Determined such conduct to quell.

Onwards they went with a vengeance
Then came a ringing cheer
Though many were left behind them

And to many more "Death" was near.

Hand to hand came the encounter
Amidst a rain of shells and bullets of lead
With sickening defeat for the Enemy

And many prisoners and dead.

After this fierce encounter

with such shocking defeat for the "Runs"
Thaysmilingly answered the "Roll Call"
Such are our Valiant Sons.

The snow was now falling gently
It was nearing the dead of night
When the relieving regiments reached them
Their duty to do, Dark or Light.

Just quietly they exchanged places
with simply a word or a grin
And the tired relieved one shaped up smartly

Such is the Army Discipline.

Back away they marched through the darkness
To just beyond the "Firing Line"
Where they hoped for a few hours leisure

For they had letters to write if they had time.
