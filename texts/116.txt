I had worn mine as although it was dry the weather was frosty. He never
spoke a word to me as we rode along. I might not have existed as far as
he was concerned. When we reached the cross-roads where the troops were to
assemble I observed a long line of Motor—Buses drawn up by the side of the
road. These buses had been shipped over from England and were General
mnibuees of the B. type with the open top deck. They were painted Black all
over and the windows were boarded over. Although it was not very far to
Ypres this was deemed to be a very efficient manner in conveying troops,
as in the darkness these Buses could practically glide up and disgorge their

lead of troops.

I marvelled at all I had seen since arriving in the Country. The War was
only three months old. England had declared War on Germany on August the
Fourth‘191h. It was the end of October 191k. And yet I had seen English
Motor Lorries, English Motor Buses, English horses and English Guns.

The forage for the horses. The Rations for the Army. The Shells and
Ammunition. All came from England. It was a marvel of transport.

“Where was the German Navy that allowed this to be permitted?". The
answer was of course — Britannia Ruled the Waves. The answer was thanks
to our splendid Silent Navy, these transport ships of Qurs were enabled to
cross the English Channel to France. And I venture to submit there is not
a British soldier who served with the British Expeditionary Force in France

and Belgium who has not at some time or other uttered these words —

GOD WE HAVE A BRITISH NAVY.
