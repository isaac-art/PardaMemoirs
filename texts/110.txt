The call. had been For Your King and Country
For Christmas he did not care a rap

His Duty was watching the Germans

And he longed for the Final Scrap

Later relieved from his vigil

He sat down for a smoke and a rest
His eyes closed seeking slumber
He thought of those he loved Bast.

These were his wife and children

In England - not so far away

And he wondered if haypiness had found them
On this same Christmas Day.

But ere he was sound in slumber
The “Call" it woke him up

And he knew the enemy was advancing
By the boom of a big "Krupp".

The Order came - Line your trenches
at 500 - Rapid - Commence
Each sprang up In duty'sfull senses

Not one man held back in suspense.

But gripping their rifles tightly
With faces that were stern and grim
Meaning not to treat the Enemy lightly
But to push their bayonets in.

For well they remembered German Culture
Which they spelt with a capital "K"
And the suffering women and children too

That they had all seen — Belgium way.
