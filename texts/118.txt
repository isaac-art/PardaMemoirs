Next day, Vincent and I dressed in our Sunday Best set off with Parda.
It was a day I still recall in detail. We were greeted like long lost
relatives. The old Nun showed us around and told us about Katie's death.
It seems she was quite mischievous, what is known today as hyperactive,
there were some celebrations in the Convent at the time, and being very
excitable had started to slide down the banisters of the spiral staircase
She slipped and fell from almost the top. We were shown Katie's grave
in the corner of a small cemetery. she was buried amongst the Nuns.
Parda was very impressed by the way the grave was lovingly kept, and I
think he came away that day very content that his beloved sister's body

was resting in such a peaceful place.

I hope the rest of the family will enjoy his story, and will realise
how much we all owe Parda and his generation.

Once again, my apologies for holding onto this book for so long, but I really felt I was it's guardian.

God bless you all
